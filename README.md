Tutorial on using PORT variables on Arduino Mega2560s and related systems

Update 22-Mar-2017
Moved the defines and functions into seperate include files, both are required.

    USAGE: Drop both .h files into the root of your porject and #include them in your code.
    
This is set up as a single file include system so the functions are defined in the .h file.
 

Update 19-Mar-2017
I'm still working on this but you will find the readMega and writeMega functions are fully tested

You can figure out what I'm doing by looking at the code. 

hit me up if you find this, want to use it, and aren't sure what to do next ;-)

I will be turning this into a complete Arduino libary over the next couple of weeks.

This is a 100% unpaid project so it gets time when I'm bored.
