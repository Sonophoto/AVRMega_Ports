Tutorial on using PORT variables on Arduino Mega2560s and related systems

Update 19-Mar-2017
I'm still working on this but you will find the readMega and writeMega functions are fully tested

You can figure out what I'm doing by looking at the code. 

hit me up if you find this, want to use it, and aren't sure what to do next ;-)
