# AVRMega_Ports

Library for fast access to Arduino ATmega2560 digital pins 22-53

Update 23-Mar-2017
Added a new directory for a program "Logica" that will demonstrate the library.
   Hopefully, this might turn out to be a useful arduino application as well.
Added a new directory for an Arduino project that runs a test suite.
   Tests are run on the files in place, unmodified, in the parent directory.
Added a libraries.properties file for the arduino archives.

Update 22-Mar-2017
Moved the defines and functions into seperate include files, both are required.

    USAGE: Drop both .h files into the root of your project and #include them in your code.
    
This is set up as a single file include system so the functions are defined in the .h file.
 

Update 19-Mar-2017
I'm still working on this but you will find the readMega and writeMega functions are fully tested.

You can figure out what I'm doing by looking at the code. 

hit me up if you find this, want to use it, and aren't sure what to do next ;-)

I will be turning this into a complete Arduino libary over the next couple of weeks.

This is a 100% unpaid project so it gets time when I'm bored.
